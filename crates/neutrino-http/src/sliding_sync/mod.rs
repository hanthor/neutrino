//! Endpoint: `POST /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.simplified_msc3575/sync`.
//! Generic over `S: StorageBackend` so this compiles against the trait alone;
//! production wiring (mapping `SyncState<SqliteStore>` into the axum router)
//! lands when the sqlite `StorageBackend` impl is finished.
//!
//! Per-connection state lives in `ConnRegistry`; see its docs for the lifecycle

// Items here are reachable from `tests` but not from the live router yet, which
