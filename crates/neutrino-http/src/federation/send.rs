//! `PUT /_matrix/federation/v1/send/{txnId}` — inbound federation transaction.
//!
//! A transaction is an envelope of up to 50 PDUs (plus EDUs, which this server
//! stubs out — they are deserialized for shape validation and dropped). Each
//! PDU is a fully-formed v12 event; we parse it via
//! [`neutrino_event::event_builder::from_wire`] (which derives the event_id
//! under the room's version, verifies/redacts on content-hash mismatch, and
//! runs the format + semantic validators).
//!
//! ## Stage-then-async
//!
//! The handler does **not** integrate PDUs synchronously. It durably **stages**
//! each parsed PDU into the pre-auth `staged_events` table (keyed by the
//! event_id it just computed) and returns 200 immediately. The background
//! worker ([`neutrino_engine::worker`]) toposorts, auth-checks, gap-fills, and
//! persists each room's staged PDUs off the request path. This keeps the
//! response off the auth + peer-backfill round-trips, and means a PDU is
//! durably accepted before it is acknowledged — `RoomCore`'s persisted-check
//! makes the eventual (re-)application idempotent, so the handler's job is
//! *durable accept*, not full processing.
//!
//! The per-PDU result map is therefore optimistic: a successfully-staged PDU
//! gets `{}` (the spec's `error` field is optional and senders ignore it). A
//! PDU dropped because its room is at the staging cap carries an `error`.
//!
//! ## Trust model
//!
//! Requires an `X-Matrix` header (network-attested origin — see
//! [`crate::federation::auth`]). Signatures, on a signed deployment, are NOT
//! checked here: the inbound worker re-admits every staged PDU under the
//! deployment policy and is the sole authority on the staged→applied path, so
//! ingress parses on faith and lets the worker drop any bad-signature row.
//! The header origin is what drives txn deduplication and the worker's gap-fill
//! fetch target. The transaction's own `origin` field is optional (our sender
//! omits it); when a peer does send one it is cross-checked against the header
//! origin and a mismatch is rejected.
