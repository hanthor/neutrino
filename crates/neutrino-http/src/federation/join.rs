//! Outbound federated join (joining-server side).
//!
//! When a local user joins a room we don't host, the CSAPI `/join` handler
//! delegates here. We run the handshake against each candidate resident server
//! (`?via=` hints — a v12 room id carries no server, so we cannot derive one):
//!
//! 1. `make_join` → a membership-event template on the resident's heads.
//! 2. Complete it (fill ts, recompute the reference-hash id — no signature) and
//!    `send_join` it back.
//! 3. **Ingest** the MSC4242 `state_dag` + `timeline`: register the room from
//!    its create event, then **stage** every event and let the per-room drain
//!    worker apply them through `apply_pdu` (auth + state-res + persist). No DAG
//!    cap; incremental memory; crash-resume is free via `staged_rooms()`.
//!
//! The dance runs in a task detached from the CSAPI request, registered in
//! `App::joins` under (room, user): the request merely awaits the dance's
//! outcome, and a client that times out and retries `/join` re-attaches to
//! the running dance instead of restarting the handshake. Over a slow link
//! the send_join transfer outlives the client's HTTP timeout, and a restart
//! would discard the transfer's progress (a fresh join event → a fresh
//! transaction) while the orphaned transfer's retransmissions keep competing
//! for the link — so the join would never converge.
//!
//! The dance blocks (watching current state for our `join`) until the worker
//! grounds the DAG, or times out — on timeout the client errors but the drain
//! keeps running, so a later sync still shows the join.
