//! Event-scoped validation: wire-format parsing and provider-free semantic
//! rules.
//!
//! `parse_event`: pure-JSON wire format (required fields, JSON
//! types, ID parsing). No I/O, no semantic-rule decisions.
//! `validate_pdu`: semantic rules that work off a parsed `Event`
//! and need no provider (size limits, count limits, create structural rules,
//! rule 9, per-type content shape).
//!
//! Reference validation (v12 rule 2 + the MSC4242 `prev_state_events` triad)
//! requires provider lookups against a single room's DAG, so it is room-scoped
//! and lives in `neutrino-state` (`validate::validate_references`).
//!
//! `validate_pdu` is split out of `parse_event` so downstream callers
//! (`RoomCore::apply`) don't have to take "you ran parse_event already" as
//! a precondition. Both `EventBuilder::build` / `from_wire` and
//! `RoomCore::apply` run validate_pdu explicitly; apply also runs it
//! defensively so a hand-constructed `Event` can't bypass the semantic
//! checks.
//!
//! Every check is annotated inline with its spec citation.
