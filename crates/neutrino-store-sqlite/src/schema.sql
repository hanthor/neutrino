-- neutrino-store-sqlite — V1 schema (bundled, no migration framework yet).
-- See docs/2026-05-14-sqlite-storage-backend.md for the design rationale.
--
-- This file only ever runs against a fresh database; the loader gates on
-- `PRAGMA user_version` before executing it. See "Open path: version gate
-- & schema bundle" in the design doc.
--
-- Surrounding PRAGMAs are owned by `schema::ensure_schema`, not by this
-- file:
--   * `journal_mode = WAL` is set against the bare connection before
--     the bundle runs (SQLite forbids journal-mode changes inside a
--     transaction).
--   * `user_version = 1` is stamped inside the same transaction that
--     wraps this file's DDL, immediately before commit. That keeps
--     "schema present" and "version stamp set" atomic — a mid-bundle
--     failure rolls back both together, leaving `user_version` at 0
--     so the next open re-runs the (non-`IF NOT EXISTS`) bundle.
--
-- Per-connection PRAGMAs (foreign_keys=ON, synchronous=NORMAL,
-- busy_timeout=5000, trusted_schema=OFF) are applied by the deadpool init
-- hook on every connection check-out, NOT here — they don't persist in
-- the DB file.

-- rooms — RoomStore
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- `room_version` CHECK pins the only wire identifier this server accepts —
-- mirrors `neutrino_common::ROOM_VERSION_ID` (MSC4242-on-v12). Defends
-- against a corrupt-DB / bad-migration path where a row with a different
-- string gets inserted: the trait read paths would otherwise see
-- `RoomVersionId::Custom(<wrong-string>)` (ruma maps unknown strings to
-- Custom rather than erroring) and propagate it silently. The string is
-- duplicated here rather than templated because it's both a schema-level
-- invariant *and* a stability promise — if/when the value ever changes
-- the schema needs an explicit migration, not a silent code edit.
-- `forward_extremities` / `state_dag_forward_extremities` persist the two
-- head-sets of a room's `RoomCore` (neutrino-state) so the per-room actor
-- can be rebuilt after a restart without replaying the whole DAG:
--   * `forward_extremities`           — timeline-DAG heads (events not yet
--                                       referenced by any event's `prev_events`).
--   * `state_dag_forward_extremities` — state-DAG heads (state events not yet
--                                       referenced by any `prev_state_events`).
-- Both are JSON arrays of event ids. `DEFAULT '[]'` covers the create-time
-- INSERT (which omits them); the storage-side apply+persist path is what
-- maintains them thereafter. No `user_version` bump — no live data, schema
-- amended in place (same policy as the `events.rejected` column).

-- (m.room.create, m.room.power_levels, etc.), only SQL NULL is disallowed.
-- `membership` is non-NULL exactly for m.room.member rows, enforced by
-- the CHECK below — m.room.member must hold a canonical value, every
-- other event_type must be NULL. This catches the case where a malformed
-- m.room.member event with no `content.membership` would otherwise have
-- been silently persisted with NULL membership and then quietly filtered
-- out of joined_rooms / joined_members.
--
-- The composite FK on (event_id, room_id, event_type, state_key) enforces
-- that every current_state row references an `events` row that agrees on

-- would leak through every StateStore read path. With the composite FK
-- the schema rejects those writes outright. SQL three-valued logic
-- handles the non-state case naturally: `events.state_key IS NULL` makes
-- the FK equality UNKNOWN, so the FK match never resolves to TRUE.
-- See state.rs module docstring for the read-side consequence (JOINs

-- One interval row per (room, type, state_key) value that has ever been part

-- axis as the server's view of the room evolves. This is the state-group
-- implementation: rather than a snapshot (or snapshot+delta chain) per event,
-- a single transition log. It lets state-before-an-event be reconstructed by
-- an indexed interval query instead of a recursive `prev_state_events` walk
-- back to the create event — the read path the federation auth of an old
-- received event needs.
--
--   * `start_pos` — the `stream_pos` of the event at which this value entered
--                   the resolved state for its slot.
--   * `end_pos`   — the `stream_pos` at which it left (was superseded or
--                   removed); NULL means it is still live.
--
-- `stream_pos` is a valid topological order of the state DAG (a child is never
-- persisted before its `prev_state_events`), so the interval query
-- `start_pos <= P AND (end_pos IS NULL OR end_pos > P)` reconstructs the
-- DAG-correct state-after the event at `P`, forks included — see
-- `SqliteStateProvider::state_after`. Maintained transactionally by
-- `maintain_room_state`, called from `persist_resolved_event` and `create_room`
-- — every path that persists a state event keeps it complete, so it is read
-- back unconditionally (no per-room gate; the DB only ever runs against a fresh
-- schema, so there is no un-indexed legacy data).
--
-- PK `(room_id, event_type, state_key, start_pos)` is unique because a slot
-- changes at most once per `stream_pos` (one event), and serves the
-- open-then-close maintenance. It does NOT serve the point-in-time read
-- (`state_after`): that query constrains `room_id` (=) and `start_pos`/`end_pos`
-- (ranges) but not `event_type`/`state_key`, so against the PK the planner can
-- only seek on `room_id` and then scans every historic row in the room. The
-- `ix_room_state_at` index puts `start_pos` directly behind `room_id` so the
-- range bound is usable — chiefly helping historical reads (auth of an old
-- received event, the feature's purpose), where `start_pos <= P` prunes events
-- that did not yet exist at `P`. The partial `ix_room_state_live` index covers
-- the live set, which is the maintenance diff baseline.

-- staged_events — StagingStore
-- A pre-auth holding pen for federation ancestry fetched while gap-filling a

-- still be invalid by DAG position), and an un-vetted event must never be
-- given a stream position or surface in any read / state-res path. So this
-- table is deliberately invisible to every other store read: just the raw
-- wire bytes keyed by their computed event_id (`json` is the canonical
-- post-`from_wire` form, so `event_id` ↔ `json` round-trips).
--
-- The gap-fill loop stages fetched ancestry here, walks `events ∪
-- staged_events` via `prev_state_events` (see StagingStore::ancestry_gap) to
-- find the still-missing frontier, asks the peer only for that frontier, and
-- once the ancestry is grounded promotes the staged subgraph through the
-- per-room actor (where auth, stream positions, and verdicts finally happen)
-- and deletes it from here. Durable across restarts, so a later inbound
-- retry resumes from the cached prefix rather than refetching everything.
--
-- `origin` is the server that sent the PDU (or, for ancestry fetched during
-- gap-fill, the server we asked) — the per-row target the background worker
-- re-asks when it needs to fill a deeper gap. Per-row, not per-room, since

-- CANNOT go through `RoomCore::apply_pdu` — there is no state DAG to auth it
-- against — so it lives here, outside `events` / `current_state`, and is
-- invisible to every state-res / timeline read path.
--
-- Keyed by (room_id, state_key): for an invite member event the `state_key` is
-- the invited user, so the pair is unique. `INSERT OR REPLACE` on the PK gives
-- latest-invite-wins (a peer may re-invite after a decline; the freshest
-- stripped state is the one to render). Only the canonical invite event `json`
-- is stored — every other field (event_id, type, sender, ts, content,
-- prev_events) is derivable from it, so `get_invite` rehydrates via the
-- verbatim `compute_event_id` + `parse_event` path (mirrors how
-- `staged_events` rehydrates from `json` alone — no denormalised columns to

-- E2EE — E2eeStore
-- The server's share of end-to-end encryption: public key material and
-- ciphertext addressed to devices, all wire-verbatim JSON text. Memory is the
-- authoritative copy at runtime (see neutrino-http's E2eeState); these rows
-- are written through and reloaded at start so a restart forgets nothing.
-- One-time keys are rows so a claim is a DELETE, never a rewrite of a blob.
-- The inbox id is caller-assigned (a process-lifetime counter seeded from
-- MAX(inbox_id)) so memory and disk agree on which rows a drain removes.
