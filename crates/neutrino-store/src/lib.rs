/// Bridge a store to a read-only [`StateProvider`] view of itself.
///
/// The per-room actor in the engine owns the state machine (`RoomCore`) but
/// not a store connection, so it cannot build a provider directly. This hands
/// it one for the duration of `f` — `f` runs the apply (a read: immutable
/// events + auth chains, no write transaction) and returns an owned result.
///
/// Kept out of [`StorageBackend`] deliberately: the generic method is not
/// object-safe, so folding it into the super-trait would make
/// `dyn StorageBackend` impossible. Consumers bound on both:
/// `S: StorageBackend + WithStateProvider`.
///
/// `R` must own its result — the provider lives only for the call to `f`, so a
/// returned value cannot borrow from it.
