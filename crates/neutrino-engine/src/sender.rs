//! Outbound federation delivery: the per-destination sender pool.
//!
//! Drains the durable `outbox` (populated atomically with each accepted event
//! — see `EventStore::persist_resolved_event`) and PUTs transactions to peers
//! via `neutrino-http`'s `FederationClient`. This is where the "events MUST eventually be sent
//! / never lost / retry on restart" clause of the Server-Server `/send` task
//! lives.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! - **One task per destination.** It drains that destination's pending PDUs in
//!   causal (insertion) order, chunking to [`MAX_PDUS_PER_TXN`] per transaction,
//!   and removes a batch from the outbox only after the peer returns 2xx. When
//!   the destination drains empty it blocks on a [`watch::Receiver<StreamPos>`]
//!   clone (advanced by every persist) and re-drains on the next wake-up.
//! - **A supervisor task** owns the discovery side: on startup and on every
//!   watch advance it enumerates [`neutrino_store::FederationOutbox::pending_destinations`] and
//!   spawns a task for any destination not already running. Idle destination
//!   tasks stay alive (bounded by the size of the mesh) rather than being
//!   reaped and respawned.
//!
//! ## Flood control on startup
//!
//! On a restart with a large backlog, every destination would otherwise fire at
//! once. Two bounds prevent that thundering herd:
//!
//! - **Startup jitter.** Destinations present in the *first* enumeration round
//!   wait a random `[0, config.startup_jitter]` before their first drain. Spreads
//!   the restart burst. Destinations discovered *later* (a live send to a new
//!   peer) drain immediately — no added latency on the common path.
//! - **A global send semaphore.** At most `NEUTRINO_OUTBOUND_CONCURRENCY` (default
//!   `DEFAULT_OUTBOUND_CONCURRENCY`, min 1) transactions are in flight across
//!   all destinations at once. A backing-off destination holds no permit, so it
//!   never starves a healthy one.
//!
//! ## Failure handling
//!
//! - **4xx** from a peer = the transaction was malformed/rejected at the
//!   envelope level (the inbound handler only 4xxs the whole transaction, never
//!   an individual PDU). Retrying won't help, so the batch is dropped from the
//!   outbox and we move on.
//! - **5xx / transport / unreachable** = transient. Retry the same batch after
//!   an exponential backoff (full jitter, doubling `BACKOFF_BASE` → capped at
//!   `BACKOFF_CAP`); never remove until a 2xx. Backoff state is in-memory
//!   only, so a restart re-enumerates and retries within the startup jitter
//!   window — restarting the app is a way to "kick" a stuck destination.
