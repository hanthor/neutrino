//! Per-room state machine orchestration.
//!
//! `RoomCore::apply(event, provider)` integrates a single incoming event
//! against the receipt-of-PDU checks the spec defines at
//! <https://spec.matrix.org/v1.18/server-server-api/#checks-performed-on-receipt-of-a-pdu>.
//! Reading the spec's numbered list against our implementation:
//!
//! - **Step 1** (PDU schema / required fields): wire-format part is
//!   upstream of `apply` (`validate::parse_event` — enforced by
//!   `EventBuilder::build()` / `Event::from_wire`). The semantic rules
//!   that don't need a provider (count limits, create structural rules,
//!   rule 9, per-type content shape) run inside `apply` via
//!   `validate::validate_pdu`. Running validate_pdu here
//!   defensively means a caller that hand-constructs an `Event` (bypassing
//!   the builder/wire path) still can't smuggle a semantically-malformed
//!   event past us.
//! - **Step 2** (signature verification): intentionally skipped per
//!   `CLAUDE.md` — trusted-network policy.
//! - **Step 3** (auth check against the event's auth_events): under
//!   MSC4242 the wire-level `auth_events` field is gone; the equivalent
//!   check is "auth against state-before-event", which we derive from
//!   `prev_state_events` via `state_res::state_at_heads`.
//! - **Step 4** (auth check against state-at-event): removed under
//!   MSC4242 / state DAGs — step 3 subsumes it.
//! - **Step 5** (soft-fail check against current room state): we run
//!   `check_auth_rules` against `current_state` for **non-state events
//!   only**. State events are not soft-failed (matches synapse's behaviour
//!   in `_check_for_soft_fail`). A soft-failed event is still persisted
//!   (Matrix soft-fail semantics) — the `soft_failed` flag on the persisted
//!   `Event` lets storage keep it out of client timelines.
//! - **Step 6** (state-set check): removed under MSC4242 / state DAGs.
//!
//! Local additions on top of the spec list: reference validation
//! (`validate::validate_references`) runs before the auth checks to
//! ensure the room exists and `prev_state_events` are well-formed.
//!
//! ## What `apply` mutates
//!
//! On a hard-rejected event (room_id mismatch, reference invalid, auth
//! fails against state-before-event), `apply` returns `Err(CoreError)`
//! and does NOT mutate `RoomCore`. On acceptance:
//! - **every accepted, non-soft-failed event** advances the timeline forward
//!   extremities (`forward_extremities`): the parents listed in the event's
//!   `prev_events` are removed and the event itself is inserted. This holds
//!   for state and non-state events alike — both sit in the timeline DAG. A
//!   soft-failed event is the exception: it is persisted but does NOT advance
//!   the timeline heads (Synapse parity, synapse#5269 / #5274).
//! - **state events** additionally advance the state forward extremities
//!   (parents in `prev_state_events` removed, the new event inserted), then
//!   recompute `current_state` by state-resolving across the new state-FE
//!   set. Mutation is committed atomically after every fallible call has
//!   succeeded. State events that pass auth are never soft-failed.
//! - **non-state events** run the soft-fail check against the existing
//!   `current_state` (which they do not change); only if the event is not
//!   soft-failed do the timeline heads advance.
